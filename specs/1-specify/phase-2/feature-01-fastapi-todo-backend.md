# Feature Specification: Multi-User Todo API Backend

**Feature Branch**: `1-fastapi-todo-backend`
**Created**: 2026-02-11
**Status**: In Progress
**Input**: User description: "Build a persistent, multi-user Todo REST API that allows users to manage their personal tasks with proper access controls."

## Constitutional Compliance

This specification adheres to the Todo Evolution Constitution by:
- Following the SDD Loop (Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement)
- Supporting the mandatory monorepo structure
- Ensuring traceability to task IDs in `specs/3-tasks/`
- Aligning with the technology stack requirements (FastAPI, SQLModel, PostgreSQL)
- Maintaining security and privacy standards (user isolation, JWT validation)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Manage Personal Tasks (Priority: P1)

A user wants to create, view, update, and delete their personal tasks through an API. They should be able to mark tasks as completed and see only their own tasks.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of a todo application and provides the primary value to users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a user, adding tasks, viewing them, updating them, and deleting them. Delivers the core value of a todo app.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is authenticated, **When** they create a new task, **Then** the task is saved and returned with all details
2. **Given** a user has created tasks, **When** they request their task list, **Then** they receive only their own tasks
3. **Given** a user has a task, **When** they update the task details, **Then** the task is updated with new information and timestamp
4. **Given** a user has a task, **When** they delete the task, **Then** the task is removed from their list
5. **Given** a user has a task, **When** they toggle its completion status, **Then** the task's completion status is updated with a new timestamp

---

### User Story 2 - Secure Task Access (Priority: P2)

A user should only be able to access their own tasks and should receive appropriate error messages when trying to access others' tasks.

**Why this priority**: Essential for privacy and security of user data.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to access tasks owned by different users and verifying appropriate access controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user attempts to access another user's task, **When** they make the API request, **Then** they receive an access denied error
2. **Given** a user attempts to modify another user's task, **When** they make the API request, **Then** they receive an access denied error
3. **Given** a user attempts to delete another user's task, **When** they make the API request, **Then** they receive an access denied error

---

### User Story 3 - Error Handling (Priority: P3)

When users encounter errors (validation, authentication, etc.), the system should return clear, structured error responses.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience by providing clear feedback when things go wrong.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering various error conditions and verifying appropriate error responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user sends invalid data, **When** they make an API request, **Then** they receive an appropriate error response with validation details
2. **Given** a user attempts to access a non-existent task, **When** they make the API request, **Then** they receive a resource not found error
3. **Given** a user makes a request without proper authentication, **When** they make the API request, **Then** they receive an authentication required error

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to update a task that doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle server failures during API requests?
- What occurs when a user tries to create a task with invalid data?
- How does the system behave when multiple users try to access the same resource simultaneously?

- **FR-014**: System MUST provide user registration endpoint (POST /api/auth/register) that creates a user and returns a JWT token
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide user login endpoint (POST /api/auth/login) that validates credentials and returns a JWT token
- **FR-016**: System MUST support pagination on task list endpoints with configurable skip/limit (default 20, max 100)

### Technical Constraints

- **TC-001**: API MUST respond to 95% of requests within 500ms under normal load (up to 100 concurrent users)
- **TC-002**: System MUST support at least 10,000 tasks per user
- **TC-003**: System MUST handle up to 100 concurrent users during peak usage
- **TC-004**: All API endpoints MUST implement rate limiting (max 1000 requests per hour per user)
- **TC-005**: All external API calls MUST have timeout values (max 30 seconds)
- **TC-006**: Database connections MUST use connection pooling
- **TC-007**: System MUST implement circuit breaker pattern for external service calls

### Security Requirements

- **SR-001**: System MUST validate JWT tokens on every request

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Represents a registered user of the system with unique identifier, email (unique), hashed password, and creation timestamp
  - Attributes: id (UUID primary key), email (unique string), hashed_password (encrypted string), created_at (timestamp)
  - Related: Has many Task entities (one-to-many relationship with back-reference)
- **Task**: Represents a todo item with title, optional description, completion status, timestamps, and relationship to a User owner
  - Attributes: id (UUID primary key), title (string, max 255 chars), description (optional string, max 5000 chars), is_completed (boolean), created_at (timestamp), updated_at (timestamp), owner_id (foreign key to User)

## Non-Goals

The following features are explicitly NOT part of this specification and will be addressed in future iterations:

- Advanced task features (due dates, priorities, categories, tags)
- Task sharing between users
- Email notifications or reminders
- Mobile app or web interface (this is backend API only)
- File attachments to tasks
- Bulk operations on tasks
- Task search or filtering beyond basic retrieval

## Error Handling Specifications

### Response Format

All responses (successful and error) MUST follow this consistent JSON format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { /* response data */ },
  "error": null
}
```

For error responses:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {} // Optional additional details
  }
}
```

### Error Types

- **ET-001**: Validation errors (400 Bad Request) - invalid input data
- **ET-002**: Authentication errors (401 Unauthorized) - missing/invalid tokens
- **ET-003**: Authorization errors (403 Forbidden) - insufficient permissions
- **ET-004**: Resource not found (404 Not Found) - requested resource doesn't exist
- **ET-005**: Server errors (500 Internal Server Error) - unexpected server issues

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-02-11

- Q: How should the get_current_user_id dependency function extract the user ID from JWT tokens? → A: From the Authorization header as a Bearer token
- Q: How should the SQLModel relationship between User and Task be implemented? → A: With back-reference from User to Tasks (one-to-many)
- Q: What should be the exact response format for successful operations? → A: Consistent format that mirrors the error response structure
- Q: What are the exact character limits for task titles and descriptions? → A: No strict limits, but validate for reasonable lengths (Title: 255, Description: 5000)
- Q: How should the API validate that the user_id in the URL path matches the authenticated user? → A: Both path comparison AND database verification
