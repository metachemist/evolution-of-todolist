# Structure Verification Report

## Monorepo-Guardian Verification

The task structure for Phase 2 has been successfully verified to comply with the constitutional requirements:

### ✅ Compliance with Constitutional Requirements:

1. **Location**: All task files are properly located in `specs/3-tasks/phase-2/` directory
2. **Format**: All files are in Markdown format (.md extension)
3. **Organization**: Tasks are organized thematically into separate files:
   - 01-project-setup.md - Project setup tasks
   - 02-database-models.md - Database and model tasks
   - 03-authentication.md - Authentication tasks
   - 04-task-crud-backend.md - Backend CRUD tasks
   - 05-frontend-auth.md - Frontend authentication tasks
   - 06-frontend-task-crud.md - Frontend CRUD tasks
   - 07-polish-testing.md - Polish and testing tasks
   - 08-deployment-mcp.md - Deployment and MCP tools tasks
   - README.md - Overall structure documentation

### ✅ Task Atomicity Verification:

1. **Size**: Each task is sized appropriately (15-30 minutes)
2. **Focus**: Each task has a single, specific objective
3. **Dependencies**: Clear dependency chains are maintained
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria

### ✅ Specification Alignment (Spec-Enforcer Verification):

1. **Feature Requirements**: All tasks align with feature specifications in `specs/1-specify/features/`
2. **Architecture Requirements**: Tasks implement the architectural patterns defined in `specs/2-plan/`
3. **Domain Entities**: Tasks properly implement the domain entities defined in `specs/1-specify/domain/`
4. **User Journeys**: Tasks support the user journeys defined in `specs/1-specify/user-journeys/`

### ✅ MCP Tool Integration:

1. **Constitutional Compliance**: MCP tools are implemented as required by the constitution
2. **Statelessness**: All MCP tools follow stateless architecture principles
3. **Clear Contracts**: MCP tools have well-defined input/output schemas
4. **Error Handling**: MCP tools return structured error objects as required

### Summary

The Phase 2 task breakdown is fully compliant with both constitutional requirements and specification alignment. The tasks are properly atomized, appropriately sized, and organized thematically for efficient development and review.
